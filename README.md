### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± My name is Claire Gao.<br></br>
ðŸŒŸ I just finished a four-month internship in an e-sport company called Stryda as a front-end developer. It has been an incredible journey during the past four months. During my internship at Stryda, I had the opportunity to dive into a large-scale project using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. Collaborating closely with the team, we continuously updated and optimized website code, ensuring the delivery of products that exceeded user expectations.
