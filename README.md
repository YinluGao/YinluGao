### Hi there 👋
🌱 My name is Claire Gao.<br></br>
🌟 I just finished a four-month internship as a front-end developer in an e-sport company called Stryda. It has been an incredible journey during the past four months. During my internship at Stryda, I had the opportunity to dive into a large-scale project using React, TypeScript, Node.js and Tailwind. Collaborating closely with the team, we continuously updated and optimized website code, ensuring the delivery of products that exceeded user expectations.

🌿 I'm currently in my second year at Hyper Island's front-end developer program. I've honed my web development skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Typescript, and Tailwind. Additionally, I possess backend knowledge in Node.js and PostgreSQL. My coding experience includes completing various school projects, like client briefs for a dating app called Haystack, using Figma, a 3D drone store website using React, and a horses' tech blanket mobile app using React Native. 

⭐ In my spare time, I enjoy travelling, skiing, dressing up, and playing Nintendo video games. I also hope to have the opportunity to connect with people from diverse cultures and exchange opinions with each other.
